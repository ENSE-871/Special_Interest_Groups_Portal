## Background and Business Need

Currently Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA) provides a digital habitat for the Special Interest Groups (SIG). However, the existing website is outdated and lacks to provide an optimal user experience. Moreof, the website does not have the tools that are mandatory and will enhance a SIG experience to be more productive. With the user feedback, it has become apparent that there is a gap in the community, making it challenging for SIGs to connect with others who share similar interests and could potentially help each other by collaborating.

## Opportunity


## Northstar & Carryover customers
NorthStar (target) customer: Special Interest Groups (SIG)<br>
Carryover customers: Other CEEA members, general public including students and teachers.
