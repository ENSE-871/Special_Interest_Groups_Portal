## Background and Business Need

Currently Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA) provides a digital habitat for the Special Interest Groups (SIG). However, the existing website is outdated and lacks to provide an optimal user experience. Moreof, the website does not have the tools that are mandatory and will enhance a SIG experience to be more productive. With the user feedback, it has become apparent that there is a gap in the community, making it challenging for SIGs to connect with others who share similar interests and could potentially help each other by collaborating.

## Opportunity

This is an opportunity to create a platform where SIG members can collaborate seamlessly and express their shared interests effortlessly. By enhancing features and offering additional tools, this platform can boost productivity and maximize outcomes. Such a platform would allow educators to engage with a broader audience and individuals with the same interest. 

## Northstar & Carryover customers

NorthStar (target) customer: CEEA Special Interest Groups of Humanities and Engineering<br>
Carryover customers: Other CEEA SIG members, general public including students and teachers.
